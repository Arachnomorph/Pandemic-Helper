# Pandemic Helper

A companion app for the Pandemic series of boardgames.

## How does it work?

- At the start of the game, follow the rulebook, and every time you would draw an infection card, and add it to the infection discard pile, write its name in the textbox and push the button/hit enter.
- Do the same for the cards drawn at the end of a player turn.
- Whenever an epidemic card is drawn, add another card from the bottom of the infection pile to the infection discard pile and push 'Shuffle all'.
- After the first epidemic, the cards drawn at the end of a player turn will repeat themselves. Push 'discard' next to the name corresponding to the card drawn.
- If you make a mistake, you can shuffle single cards, or delete a card entirely.

## Why is it useful?

- After shuffling cards during an epidemic, you may want to know when will the repeating cards run out from the top of the pile.
- Also, during a game, you may end up with multiple discrete stacks of infection cards on top of each other.
- Remembering these may let you plan player turns more effectively.
- It's not impossible to remember all of that information or write it down on a piece of paper, but using this app might be more convenient.
